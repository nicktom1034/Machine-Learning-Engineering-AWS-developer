**Chapter 2: Deep Learning AMIs** <br />
This chapter introduces the Deep Learning AMIs and how these are used to help machine learning practitioners perform ML experiments faster inside EC2 instances. Here, we will also dive a bit deeper into how AWS pricing works for EC2 instances so that we will have a better idea on how to optimize and reduce the overall
costs of running ML workloads in the cloud.
